        <p class="textAfterCozyHouse">Currently we have 121 dogs and 342 cats on our hands and statistics 
            show that only 20% of them will find a family. The others will 
            continue to live with us and will be waiting for a lucky chance 
            to become dearly loved.</p>
        <p class="textTwoAfterCozyHouse">We feed our wards with the best food and make sure that they do 
            not get sick, feel comfortable (including psychologically) and 
            well. We are supported by 87 volunteers and 28 employees of 
            various skill levels. About 12% of the animals are taken by the 
            shelter staff. Taking care of the animals, they become attached 
            to the pets and would hardly ever leave them alone.</p>
